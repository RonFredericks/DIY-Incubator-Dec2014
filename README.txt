DIY CO2 Incubator for Mammalian Cell Culture

December 2014

In this repository there are are 4 bits of code for testing and 1 piece of control code for controlling the CO2 incubator.

Complete instructions for building and implementing the incubator are available at:
http://www.pellinglab.net/diy/diyco2incubator/

Test code:
- Test_CO2_Sensor: Simple test code for the cozir CO2 sensor
- Test_PWM_Fan_Control: Simple test code for the DC fan
- Test_Single_Relay: Simple test code for an SPDT relay switch
- Test_Two_DS18B20_Sensors: Simple test code for measuring the individual and average temperature across two DS18B20 sensors

Control Code:
- DIY_CO2_Incubator_Dec2014: Control code for the incubator once it is assembled
